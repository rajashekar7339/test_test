    - Privilege escalation (sudo, su, chmod 777)
    - Network operations (wget/curl to unknown hosts)
    - Data exfiltration patterns

    The agent returns structured output with a risk level and brief reasoning.

- medium: Moderate risk (file edits, package installs, service restarts)
- high: Significant risk (rm files, UPDATE/DELETE without WHERE, TRUNCATE, chmod dangerous permissions)
- critical: Severe/destructive (rm -rf, DROP TABLE/DATABASE, dd, format, mkfs, bq delete dataset, unfiltered mass deletes)

**Evaluate:**
- Scope (single file vs. entire system)
- Reversibility (can it be undone?)
- Data loss potential
- Privilege requirements
- Database destruction patterns

**Output:** Risk level + reasoning (max 1 sentence)."""
