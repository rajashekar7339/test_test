"""Quick-resume workspace observation hooks.

The autosave layer records a quick-resume pointer for cwd. This plugin teaches
Fid Coder about *child* workspaces touched through tools, so a later
``fid-coder -qr ./child`` (or ``/quick-resume ./child``) resolves the session
even when the process was launched from the parent directory the whole time.

Observation is a pure convenience: it only registers hashed pointer keys and
never blocks or alters tool output.
