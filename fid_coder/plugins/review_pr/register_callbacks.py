"""Plugin: `/review-pr` — hand the agent a structured PR review mission.

Usage:
    /review-pr                  Review the PR for the current branch
    /review-pr 123              Review PR #123 in the current repo
    /review-pr <github-url>     Review the PR at the given URL
    /review-pr --help           Show usage

The command itself is dumb on purpose (YAGNI): it just builds a beefy prompt
and returns it. The *agent* does the heavy lifting via `gh` + shell tools.
That keeps responsibilities clean (SRP) — plugin = command framing, agent =
code review.

{target_clause}

## Step 1 — Gather context
Run (in order, only what you need):
  1. `gh pr view <target> --json number,title,author,url,baseRefName,headRefName,body,additions,deletions,changedFiles,labels,isDraft,mergeable,reviewDecision`
  2. `gh pr diff <target>` to read the actual diff
  3. `gh pr checks <target>` for CI status
  4. (Optional) `gh pr view <target> --comments` if you need existing discussion

If any command fails (auth, not-a-repo, no PR), surface a clean error and stop.

## Step 2 — Analyze
Walk the diff and judge it on:
  - **Correctness** — bugs, off-by-ones, race conditions, error handling, edge cases
  - **Design** — SOLID, DRY, YAGNI violations; leaky abstractions; tight coupling
  - **Readability** — naming, function size, comments where the *why* is non-obvious
  - **Tests** — coverage for new logic, missing edge cases, brittle mocks
  - **Security** — injection, secrets, unvalidated input, authz gaps
  - **Performance** — obvious quadratic loops, N+1 queries, needless allocations
  - **Style/Lint** — only call out if it's actually wrong, not just taste

Honor the Zen of Python even for non-Python code.

## Step 3 — Report
Output a single markdown report with these sections (omit empty ones):

### 🐶 PR Review: <title> (#<number>)
- **Author:** …  **Base ← Head:** …  **CI:** …  **Mergeable:** …
- **TL;DR:** one-sentence verdict.

### ✅ What's good
Bullet list. Be specific — point at files/functions.

### 🔴 Blocking issues
Things that *must* be fixed before merge. Each item:
- **File:line** — what's wrong, why, and a concrete fix.

### 🟡 Suggestions (non-blocking)
Nice-to-haves, refactors, follow-ups.

### 🧪 Test gaps
Specific scenarios that should have tests.

### 🏁 Recommendation
One of: **APPROVE**, **REQUEST CHANGES**, or **COMMENT** — with a one-line justification.

## Rules
- Do **NOT** post the review to GitHub. Just print it. The user decides whether to submit.
- Don't run mutating `gh` commands (no `gh pr review --approve`, no merges, no closes).
- If the diff is huge (>1500 lines), say so and focus on the highest-signal files.
- Quote short snippets (≤10 lines) when calling out specific code.
