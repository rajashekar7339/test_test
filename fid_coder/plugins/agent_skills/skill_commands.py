Each discovered (and enabled) skill is exposed as a ``/<skill-name>`` slash
command.  Invoking it loads the full ``SKILL.md`` content and submits it
as the prompt — effectively the same thing the ``activate_skill`` tool
does, only initiated by the user.

This lives in its own module so that ``register_callbacks.py`` stays
focused on wiring callbacks (SRP, and the file-size cap).
