"""Plugin: `/btw` — ask a quick side question without derailing the task.

Runs an independent, single-turn model query (fresh throwaway agent, no
tools, no shared history) and shows the answer inline, Claude Code
style. The main conversation's context window never sees the exchange,
so minor "by the way..." curiosities stop costing you expensive tokens.

Mid-run behaviour comes free from ``run_ui._run_paused_commands``:
slash commands typed while the agent works are queued, the in-flight
stream finishes, the agent parks at its pause boundary, the command
runs with the terminal released, then the run resumes. `/btw` just has
to behave like any other blocking command inside that window — and the
dismiss-wait keeps the window open until the user has read the answer.

Usage:
    /btw <question>     One-shot side query, answer shown inline
    /btw --help         Show usage
