"""One-shot, history-free model query backing the `/btw` command.

Deliberately minimal (YAGNI): a throwaway pydantic_ai Agent with no
tools, no message history, and a tiny system prompt. The main agent's
context window never sees any of this — that's the whole point.

Threading note: ``handle_command`` executes synchronously *inside* the
already-running main event loop, so we can't ``asyncio.run`` on the
main thread. Same escape hatch as the ``steer_queue`` menu: hop to a
worker thread and give it its own loop.
