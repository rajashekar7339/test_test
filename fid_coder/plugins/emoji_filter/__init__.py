* Streaming TextPart / TextPartDelta content (rendered to the terminal).
* File-write tool args (create_file, edit_file, replace_in_file).
* Shell command strings (agent_run_shell_command).

Explicitly excluded: ThinkingPart / ThinkingPartDelta, banners, emit_* messages,
search strings (old_str / snippet), and anything else not listed above.
