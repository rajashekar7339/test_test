    The returned callback accepts ``force``: when ``True`` it skips the
    kill-running-shells step. The shell SIGINT handler uses
    ``force=True`` because it kills all shells *before* requesting the
    cancel, so sweeping them again here would be redundant.

    When ``force`` is False and shells ARE running, the callback kills
    them first and then cancels — mirroring ``_shell_sigint_handler``
    (the out-of-band SIGINT fallback path). This is load-bearing on
    EVERY platform now that Ctrl+C is a pure keybinding: Windows strips
    ENABLE_PROCESSED_INPUT and POSIX disables the tty INTR char while
    the key listener owns stdin, so ^C never becomes a SIGINT — it
    arrives as a raw ``\\x03`` and lands HERE instead of in the shell
    SIGINT handler. The old behavior (refuse + "press Ctrl+X") left
    Ctrl+C dead for the entire lifetime of every shell command:
    the run stayed active, new submissions queued as steers,
    and the eventual cancel discarded them. Killing the shells first
    preserves the guard's anti-orphan rationale (a cancelled executor
    await would otherwise leave the subprocess spewing into the
    terminal) while letting the cancel actually proceed.
