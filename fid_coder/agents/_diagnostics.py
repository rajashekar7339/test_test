"""Terminal-facing diagnostics for agent-run exceptions.

When an agent run blows up, ``str(exc)`` alone loses almost all of the
actionable signal that pydantic-ai / provider SDKs tuck onto ``__cause__``,
``__context__``, ``BaseExceptionGroup.exceptions``, or attributes like
``body`` / ``response`` / ``errors``. This module walks those paths in a
bounded, defensive way and emits structured diagnostic blocks to the terminal.

File-level logging (``log_error``) is untouched — this module only controls
what we *surface* in the terminal for the user. All ``getattr`` access is
guarded; diagnostic emit must never itself raise.
