"""Tests for the fid_kennel plugin.

Covers:
* schema initialization is idempotent
* recorder writes a single drawer to the repo wing only (no dual-write)
* FTS5 search finds drawers, optionally scoped to a wing
* passive recall block builds a sensible system-prompt fragment
* empty/garbage inputs are no-ops, not crashes
* multi-process concurrent writes don't corrupt or lose data

The multi-process test is the headline guarantee — it's the whole reason
we picked SQLite + WAL over ChromaDB.
