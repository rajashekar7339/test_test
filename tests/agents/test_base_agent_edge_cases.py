"""Tests for BaseAgent edge cases and error paths.

This module tests error handling and edge cases in BaseAgent methods:
- _load_model_with_fallback() when all models fail
- hash_message() with malformed messages
- stringify_message_part() with unusual content types
- filter_huge_messages() with corrupted messages
- get_model_context_length() when model config is broken
- load_fid_rules() with file read errors
- Compaction methods with extreme token counts

Focuses on ensuring error handling doesn't crash and provides graceful degradation.
